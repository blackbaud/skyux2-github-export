The skyux-cli would remain separate.  It's installed globally which means consumer are less likely to update it (even with the auto prompts to upgrade we implemented).  Keeping that in mind means we want to keep it as lightweight as possible and contain as little logic as possible.

It performs two basic functions:

- Globally register `skyux` as a known command.
- Handle the commands that can be run outside the context of a project: `skyux help` and `skyux new`

Perhaps as a first past, we could leave the repos/packages separate, but at least have builder require skyux2 (or vice-versa) and remove that requirement in the current skyux-template.

Possible complications to the ""quick"" approach we discussed today.  Even if we took the first approach of removing skyux-builder from the template, and moved it as a dependency for skyux, we'd have to update CLI to either not look in package.json or look for skyux instead.

Whenever you try to launch an application into Firefox the application just hangs and never loads. In order to fix this you must navigate to the `localhost` url and then follow the instructions for adding an exception for the localhost url. The warning that is shown when navigating to the `localhost` url is that the connection is not secure. After this is done, the application can launch at the `sky.blackbaud-dev.com` url. We should research whether or not we can configure things so that this exception is not needed and if this is not possible then we should document that this is required when using Firefox.

If you select the main portion of the card the event does fire but if you click directly on the checkbox it does not fire

### Steps to reproduce
Visit plunker and click on the card (not the checkbox). You will see that ""Test"" is printed below the card. Then click on the checkbox and notice that ""Test"" is not printed again.

This has a couple of drawbacks:

  - The Browserstack local tunnel can be flakey and disconnect randomly at times
  - Serving up our files with webpack doesn't allow us to have as many tests running in parallel, because they start slowing down to the point of failure as we add more.
  - Our visual tests are not being run in a environment similar to our users (SKY UX host/builder/etc)

When creating sky-grid-column elements using an ngFor I would expect the available columns to update if the list of columns updates.

### Actual behavior
If the available columns provided to the ngFor changes the sky-grid does not update to reflect these changes. This causes trying to populate a list of available columns using an HTTP call difficult as the grid does not update with the available columns once the HTTP data is returned.

### Steps to reproduce
Create a sky grid and use an ngFor to create the sky-grid-column elements. Have the variable that the ngFor references start with some initial data. In some manner, change the data for this variable and notice that the sky-grid does not update with the new columns.

https://github.com/blackbaud/skyux2/issues/329,329,"Navbar component - submenu target area","When hovering over a submenu item in the nav bar, mouse over any part of the menu will highlight the menu item you are hovering on. However, if you are not over (or nearly over) the actual text, then the link doesn't work. Hovering the text makes the font bold, but hovering the div still highlights the div. Clicking the div closes the nav menu but doesn't navigate.

This means the touch target for the menu item is much smaller and it is misleading/confusing because you see a hover state that doesn't do anything. Also, the top-level menu items have a touch target of the whole div/button area and not just the text.

Using `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` on a component that contains a tile dashboard should have the tiles on the tile dashboard be rendered when the dashboard's config property is set.

### Actual behavior

Tiles are not rendered properly until change detection triggered by some other event on the tile.

### Steps to reproduce

- Create a component that hosts a `sky-tile-dashboard`.
- Set its `changeDetection` property to `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`.
- Set the tile dashboard's config to display tiles.
- Notice that portions of the tile that are bound to a property on the controller are not displayed (you can see this in the provided Plunker where the first tile's title is not rendered and the second tile is not collapsed).

When a modal is open, the background page is dimmed so that only the controls on the modal are clickable. The dimmed area should cover the entire page, regardless of window size and scrolling

### Actual behavior
If the page has a scrollbar, you can scroll past the dimmed area and click on navigation elements, links, etc. Also, the dimmed out area scales with the resizing of the browser window. So if you reduce the height of the browser window, you can create more clickable space that isn't dimmed

### Steps to reproduce

Precondition: Have a sky page that contains enough content to need scrollbars and has an action that launches a modal.

1. Navigate to the sky page that meets the precondition and launch the modal.
2. Scroll downward on the page. You'll see that the dimmed area does not extend to the bottom of the page. ![dimming01](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/21042636/21504697/17c0bef8-cc16-11e6-8fc6-6cbf43525b77.png)

Expect tests to pass when modals are configured for multiple testbeds.

### Actual behavior
Tests fail with 'no component factory found..' errors for tests using modals after the initial tests using modals.

### Steps to reproduce
Found issues when creating unit tests for the SkyList PR #180. It only seems to create the testbed context once for the initial test associated with a modal. 

You can recreate the issue in your current codebase by duplicating the modal.component.spec.ts and having it reference a new fixture (I used a copy of modal.component.fixture.ts with a different class name).

The old tiles kept their width at 50% in this case.  I started looking at this.  It looks like add `width: 50%;` to the class `sky-tile-dashboard-layout-multi` makes this behave better.  I also noticed that the old tiles used the bootstrap grid to get that, but it seems like you're trying to avoid getting overly dependent on bootstrap for this version.

Thanks for the help.
